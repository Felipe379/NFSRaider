Create custom Tuner, Muscle and Exotic rides by spraying on custom paints types and colors, adding multiple layers of customizable vinyl's and decals. 
You can even fabricating your own Autosculpt parts including body kits, wheels, hoods, spoilers, and roof scoops.  
Customization doesn't stop there.  Looks mean nothing if you don't have the time slips to back them up, so upgrading the cars performance with engine upgrades, turbo chargers, suspension parts and more is a must.
All of this will be available for use in the full version on NFS Carbon.

ACCELERATION
HANDLING
TOP SPEED
TUNER
EXOTIC
Tuners rule the corners with tight, responsive handling. What 
tuners give up in the straights, they more than make up for 
in the turns. With all this grip, its best to keep the gas 
planted through corners and leave your opponents in the wall.
Muscle is all about straight line acceleration.  When you 
leave the rest at the line, make sure you dont focus on the 
rear view mirror for too long because its easy to get the tail 
out so pay attention to the curves!
CLASS TYPES
Exotics are for the racing purists that live for top speed. The 
weakest link in an exotic is the driver so if you think you 
have what it takes to balance the gas and brakes through 
a perfect apex then the car can do the rest.

Crazy, crazy, crazy is how everyone describes
her.  Kira is all about raw power.  She throws 
caution to the wind and thinks speed can 
over come any problem.  Her insane attitude 
has got her to where she is.  Its only a matter
of time before Kiras good luck runs out.  
Shes an accident waiting to happen.

Drag racing is won or lost based on your ability to shift. Watch the shift indicator. When it turns Green, it is time to shift. If you get a perfect shift your car accelerates faster. Over revving your engine will cause it to blow. Watch the heat level of your motor to make sure you don't blow your engine.

This is a blurb about the Jack knifing Semi and how you can avoid
it. When this happens you need to drive really really fast and steer
over to the left while simultaniously using your hand brake while
accelerating. Once you hit 88 miles per hour your flux capacitor
should kick in and it will be smooth sailing from then on.

Black List Rival #12 : Drag Specialist
Overconfident, detail oriented, and a stickler for rules, Ming rains on
everyone's parade. He has no time for cheating or bending the rules.
It's all about honor for him. He's a better than average racer who is
held back by his unwillingness to push the limits of his talents.

You ever hear of Drifting? Nah, didn't thinkso.
You're so 1999! Drifting is about sliding through 
corners with style.  Speed counts but there's 
more to it than that.  You gotta' hang your tail 
out or go home!
